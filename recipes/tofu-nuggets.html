      <h2>While these are not the ultimate chicken nugget dupe (tofu is tofu), I am obsessed with their supremely crispy cereal-crust. Put your trust in tofu!</h2>
      <h3>Makes 2-4 servings</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><h4>Press excess water out of tofu by wrapping in paper towels and setting a weight on it for about 5-10 minutes:</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 block</strong> firm tofu</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Whisk batter together and set aside in a wide, flat dish or bowl:</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
          <li><strong>1 1/2 tsp</strong> sugar</li>
          <li><strong>1 1/2 tsp</strong> sea salt</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> garlic powder</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 tsp</strong> onion powder</li>
          <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> non-dairy milk</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Crumble cereal into a separate wide, flat dish and set aside:</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3 cups</strong> unsweetened corn flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Cut tofu into nugget-sized pieces. I usually cut the block lengthwise into thirds, which creates three 'planes'. From there, I cut each plane two by three, so you should have about six per plane, or 18 pieces total.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Heat up oil in a pan on medium-high heat. It's hot enough when you add a drop of water and it sizzles:</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>2 cups</strong> peanut or vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>With one hand, dip each piece of tofu into the batter and coat. Shake to drain excess batter and toss into the cereal dish. With your other hand, cover tofu piece with cereal around it and press to make the crust. Set pieces aside on a plate or paper towel.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Add a few of the nuggets to the pan (do not overcrowd!) and fry them about 3 minutes on each side until golden brown.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Remove nuggets from the oil and drain on a paper towel. Add the next batch and repeat the steps until they are all done.</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Serve right away with your favorite dipping sauce. Enjoy!</h4></li>
      </ol>
